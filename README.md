I made this repo, to access directly to some community pre trained weights.
In my personal case, i have some problems with software configuration. The simple way is to use some pre trained weight for something else in the community!

I put models and cfgs with names separate by folders, if cant fine the .data file (to use in the command), you can generate it, simply copy some other .data to take an example... the .data file is only used to indicate link paths.
